"""Fail when an unpinned resolve holds a direct dependency below its newest release.

A scheduled drift job resolves the newest versions ``pyproject.toml`` allows
(``uv lock --upgrade``) and runs the suite. That answers "does the newest
*resolvable* set still pass", and it is silent on a second question: whether the
newest resolvable set is the newest *released* one. A resolver that cannot reach
a release does not fail. It backs off to an older version that does resolve,
logs an ordinary ``Updated`` line, and the suite passes against something nobody
chose.

That is not hypothetical. From 2.47, ``pydantic-ai-slim[ag-ui]`` declares
``ag-ui-protocol<1`` while django-ag-ui requires ``ag-ui-protocol>=1.0``, so every
unpinned resolve there stopped at slim 2.46 and the drift run went green with
2.54 on PyPI. Nothing in that project declared the ceiling: it was inherited
from another distribution's extra, which is exactly the kind of ceiling a drift
job exists to measure, and the kind it could not see.

For every **direct** requirement -- ``[project]`` dependencies, every extra and
every dependency group, because a drift job installs all of them -- this
compares the version installed in the synced environment with the newest
release that:

- is final: no pre-release, dev release or yanked file;
- admits the running Python. A drift job runs on the newest Python, and a
  release that has not reached it is not held back by anything the project
  declares;
- satisfies every specifier this project declares for the name, so a ceiling we
  wrote down (``<3``) is honoured. Declaring one, with a comment saying why, is
  how a hold is *accepted* rather than silenced;
- is at least ``--min-age-days`` old.

The age window exists because this script and the resolver read the index at
different moments, and a release published minutes ago can be visible to one and
not the other -- the same CDN lag the floor gate trips over. The default of seven
days is the Dependabot cooldown: a release younger than that would not have been
adopted here anyway, and on a weekly schedule it delays a real report by at most
one run. A newer release still inside the window is reported as a notice and
never fails the job, so it is visible without flapping.

For each hold the resolver is asked why, by re-locking with that release
required (``uv lock --dry-run --upgrade-package 'name==X'``). uv's derivation
names the requirement that excludes it. ``uv tree --invert`` cannot: the
excluding constraint usually belongs to the *newer* version of some other
distribution, which by construction never appears in the lock.

Direct only, on purpose. A transitive dependency held back is reported by the
repository that declares the conflicting pair, which is also the one that can
fix it; a project downstream of that would see the same hold and could do
nothing about it but pin.

Run it inside the synced environment, since the installed versions and the
interpreter are what it measures. ``action.yml`` does exactly this::

    uv run --no-sync python check_held_back.py --report held-back.md

Exit status: 0 when nothing is held back, 1 when something is, 2 when the check
could not look -- an unreadable index, an unparseable requirement, or an
environment that has none of the declared dependencies installed. A check that
passes when it could not look is the failure it exists to prevent.
